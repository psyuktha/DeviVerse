# DeviVerse

DeviVerse is a project focused on fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) to delve deeply into the 100 shlokas of Soundarya Lahari. The aim is to create an AI system capable of understanding, interpreting, and providing insights into the profound philosophical, spiritual, and poetic elements of the text.
