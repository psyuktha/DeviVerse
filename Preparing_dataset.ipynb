Even then, this description only mocks at the lotus flowers, as Her face cannot be compared to any visual objects. She has curly hair that fall on Her forehead, which appear like a swarm of young bees, adding beauty to Her face. The verse, by referring to young bees, conveys the softness of Her hair. Bees in general are black in colour and by comparing Her hair to bees, \\u015aa\\u1e41kar\\u0101c\\u0101rya indirectly refers to the glowing dark colour of Her hair. When She smiles, Her white teeth shines, enhancing the beauty of Her face. The young bees, which hover around Her beautiful face are compared to the eyes of \\u015aiva. The verse says that even \\u015aiva, who burnt Manmatha, is attracted by Her beautiful face.Lotus has delicious nectar inside the pollen and bees naturally swarm lotus flowers to get the best quality of honey. When they swarm around a lotus, the scenic beauty appears like Her eyes. Bees are compared to eyelashes and the white stem within the lotus petals are compared to Her teeth. All the lotus flowers do not have white stigmas, but only rare species of lotus family. By saying so, \\u015aa\\u1e41kar\\u0101c\\u0101rya has conveyed that the of beauty of Her face is unique.\\u015ar\\u012b \\u015aakti mahimna\\u1e25 (verse 39) also compares Her face to that of a fully blossomed lotus and Her teeth to that of jasmine flowers. Lalit\\u0101 Sahasran\\u0101ma 25 \\u015auddha-vidhy\\u0101\\u1e45kur\\u0101k\\u0101ra-dhvijapak\\u1e45ti-dvayojval\\u0101 describes Her teeth thus:Her teeth appear like \\u015auddha-vidy\\u0101, which means \\u015ar\\u012b Vidy\\u0101.  \\u015ar\\u012b Vidy\\u0101 is considered as the most secret and powerful ritual worship of Lalit\\u0101mbik\\u0101.  This involves a lot of rituals and each ritual has its own meaning and interpretation.  \\u015auddha means pure, vidy\\u0101 means knowledge and \\u015auddha-vidy\\u0101 means pure knowledge.  This is considered pure because this up\\u0101sana m\\u0101rg or the cult of \\u015ar\\u012b Vidy\\u0101 worship emphasizes the non-duality, \\u2018I am That\\u2019 concept.The \\u1e62oda\\u015b\\u012b mantra is considered as the seed for \\u015ar\\u012b Vidy\\u0101.  It has sixteen b\\u012bja-s.  When a seed grows into a sprout, it has two leaves.  Therefore 16 x 2 gives 32, the number of teeth in human beings.   Even though teeth have two rows placed in upper and lower jaws, the jaws are attached to each other internally.  In the same way soul (j\\u012bva) and (Brahman) God are considered as different out of ignorance when both remain the same.  \\u015ar\\u012b Vidy\\u0101 worship is to be done in seclusion, understanding the significance and meanings of the procedures.  Then only the worship yields results. In the mantra initiation procedures of Devi, there are thirty two types of d\\u012bk\\u015ba (types of initiation). Yet another interpretation is also possible.  This Sahasran\\u0101ma starts only with 32 letters out of the 51 alphabets in Sanskrit.  This 32 represents Her teeth.  This could also mean that the initiation into \\u015ar\\u012b Vidy\\u0101 cult is to be done verbally by Guru to his disciple.{Further reading on \\u015auddha-vidy\\u0101: This is the fifteenth tattva, counting from \\u015aiva.  In this tattva, the consciousness of both \\u201cI\\u201d and \\u201cThis\\u201d is equally predominant. Though the germinal universe is seen differently, yet identity runs through it as a thread.  There is identity in diversity at this stage.  Kriya is predominant tattva here.  The consciousness of this state is \\u2018I am, I and also this\\u2019.  Vidy\\u0101 tattva consists of \\u015auddha-vidy\\u0101, sahaja vidy\\u0101 and ka\\u00f1cuka (limited knowledge). Vidy\\u0101tattva consists of \\u015buddhavidy\\u0101, sahajavidy\\u0101 and vidy\\u0101ka\\u00f1cuka. \\u015auddhavidy\\u0101 here is the same as sadvidy\\u0101 (fifth tattva), while sahajavidy\\u0101 is natural knowledge (not a tattva). Natural knowledge implies the emergence of His Freedom. As sahajavidy\\u0101 (natural knowledge) is also known as \\u015buddhavidy\\u0101 (pure knowledge). }These verses attempt to describe Her beauty, so that, aspirants can comfortably visualize Her form.\",\n          \"pavitr\\u012b kartu\\u1e41 na\\u1e25 - to purify us; pa\\u015bupati par\\u0101dh\\u012bna h\\u1e5bdaye \\u2013 wholeheartedly surrendered to \\u015aiva; day\\u0101 mitrai netrai\\u1e25 - compassionate eyes; aru\\u1e47a dhavala \\u015by\\u0101ma rucibhi\\u1e25 - splendorous with red, white and black; nada\\u1e25 - rivers; \\u015bo\\u1e47o ga\\u1e45g\\u0101 \\u2013 \\u015ao\\u1e47o, Ganges; tapana tanaya\\u2013 daughter of sun, known as river Yamuna; iti \\u2013 thus; dhruvam \\u2013 surely; amu\\u1e41 - this; tray\\u0101\\u1e47\\u0101\\u1e41  t\\u012brth\\u0101n\\u0101m \\u2013 these three rivers; upanayasi sa\\u1e41bhedam anagham \\u2013 destroys our sins.\\u201cThe one who has wholeheartedly surrendered unto \\u015aiva! The One who has compassionate eyes shining with red, white and black colours! You have given us the holy confluence of three rivers, Sone, Ganges and Yamuna, to wash off our sins.\\u201dIt is believed that by taking bath in holy rivers wards off one\\u2019s sins. Here \\u015aa\\u1e41kar\\u0101c\\u0101rya talks about the confluence of three sacred rivers Sone, Ganges and Yamuna and if one takes bath in this sacred confluence, all his sins, it is believed will be washed off. It is said that Par\\u0101\\u015bakti, who has wholeheartedly surrendered to \\u015aiva, has created this confluence out of compassion for the humanity.  Waters of Sona River is said to be red in colour; waters of Ganges is said to be white in colour and waters of Yamuna is believed to be black in colour. However, \\u015by\\u0101ma also means dark blue and possibly \\u015aa\\u1e41kar\\u0101c\\u0101rya should have used the word to mean dark blue waters.The tinges of these colours were already described in the previous verse and the previous verse said that through these colours, She creates three gu\\u1e47a-s, which in turn cause creation. In addition to this description, \\u015aa\\u1e41kar\\u0101c\\u0101rya speaks about Her wholehearted surrender to \\u015aiva. This appears to be out of context. But \\u015aa\\u1e41kar\\u0101c\\u0101rya is not a person who says something out of context. So, there should be some subtle conveyance through this verse. He subtly conveys the benefit arising out of ku\\u1e47\\u1e0dalin\\u012b meditation. The three n\\u0101\\u1e0di-s i\\u1e0d\\u0101, pi\\u1e45gala and su\\u1e63umna are referred through these three rivers. These three n\\u0101\\u1e0di-s join together at \\u0101j\\u00f1\\u0101cakra, also known as third eye. In Her subtlest form ku\\u1e47\\u1e0dalin\\u012b, She ascends through su\\u1e63umna n\\u0101\\u1e0di to conjoin Her Consort \\u015aiva at sahasr\\u0101ra. There are two aspects in this interpretation. An aspirant who could activate \\u0101j\\u00f1\\u0101cakra is able to ward off his sins. After leaving \\u0101j\\u00f1\\u0101cakra, She proceeds to sahasr\\u0101ra to surrender unto \\u015aiva. Whole hearted surrender can be interpreted to mean that there will no two separate entities such as \\u015aiva and \\u015aakti at sahasr\\u0101ra. They both merge together to become one and there exists only \\u015aiva. This phenomenon is known \\u015aiva-\\u015aakti ikya and is discussed in Lalit\\u0101 Sahasran\\u0101ma 999. A yogi who is able to experience Her presence in \\u0101j\\u00f1\\u0101cakra and the presence of both \\u015aiva and \\u015aakti at sahasr\\u0101ra will have all his sins annihilated. However, this situation is possible only for those, whose karmic accounts permit this to happen. It can also be said that unless karmic account permits, even \\u0101j\\u00f1\\u0101cakra will not be activated.\",\n          \"catu\\u1e63\\u1e63\\u1e6dy\\u0101 tantrai\\u1e25 - through sixty four tantra-s; sakalam atisandh\\u0101ya bhuvana\\u1e41 - betrayed all the worlds; sthita\\u1e25 tat tat siddhi prasava para tantrai\\u1e25 - each capable of conferring various psychic powers; pa\\u015bupati\\u1e25 - \\u015aiva; puna\\u1e25 tvan nirbandh\\u0101t \\u2013 subsequently, at Your insistence; akhila puru\\u1e63\\u0101rtha eka gha\\u1e6dan\\u0101 svatantra\\u1e41 - capable of conferring all the four human pursuits; te tantra\\u1e41 - Your tantra; k\\u1e63iti talam \\u2013 the habitat world (the earth); av\\u0101t\\u012btarat \\u2013 revealed; idam \\u2013 this;\\u201c\\u015aiva, by merely revealing sixty four tantra-s that are capable of conferring various psychic powers betrayed the world. But He, due to Your insistence, has subsequently revealed Your tantra, which is capable of conferring all the four human pursuits to the world of humanity.\\u201d\\u015aiva is a Yogic Personality and always remains in meditative mood. He talks only to His Consort, Par\\u0101\\u015bakti and reveals to Her various methods to attain Him as, in order to attain final liberation, one has to merge with Him. It is only Par\\u0101\\u015bakti, who reveals \\u015aiva and He cannot be approached directly. The following scene unfolds in Mount Kaila\\u015ba (it is only my thought and does not form part of the verse). \\u015aiva is in a relaxed mood and as usual, Par\\u0101\\u015bakti is sitting close to Him. During this very rare moment, Par\\u0101\\u015bakti asks a small favour from Him. \\u201cO! My Lord! You have revealed sixty four tantra-s to the world that are capable of conferring different superhuman powers. What my devotees are going to do with these siddhi-s? My devotees will never pursue these superhuman powers (it shows Her confidence in Her devotees). They want to attain You and I want to offer them liberation by revealing You to them. Can You kindly do me a favour by revealing a tatnra to my devotees that makes them realize and in turn I will bring them (perfected devotees) up to You for conferring liberation? I will bring before You only the best of my devotees who make themselves fit by practicing the tantra that You may choose to reveal now. I am asking this favour from You for the sake of my devotees. Will You please be kind enough to oblige me, as usual?\\u201d \\u015aiva is always pleased with His Consort and agrees to reveal a tantra to attain Her. This is the crux of this verse. It is also equally important to note that liberation can be attained only by worshipping Her. Par\\u0101\\u015bakti said to \\u015aiva in Mah\\u0101nirv\\u0101\\u1e47a Tantra (IV.45), \\u201cMy Lord! I would like to know the most excellent worship of me leading to unification with You, which You have already described.\\u201d \\u015aiva says (IV.9), \\u201cOnly by worshipping You, individuals can become one with Me.\\u201d There is no other evidence required to prove that \\u015aiva can be attained only through the Divine Mother, Par\\u0101\\u015bakti. Lalit\\u0101 Sahasran\\u0101ma 727 is \\u015biva-j\\u00f1\\u0101na-prad\\u0101yin\\u012b, which means that She alone can impart knowledge of \\u015aiva.\\u015aiva reveals a \\u1e62o\\u1e0da\\u015b\\u012b mantra in Mah\\u0101nirv\\u0101\\u1e47a Tantra (V.17), which is not known to many.

It is also said that by reciting only the first three letters - hr\\u012b\\u1e41 \\u015br\\u012b\\u1e41 kr\\u012b\\u1e41 one gets material wealth (Mah\\u0101nirv\\u0101\\u1e47a Tantra V.14). The above mantra is capable of giving only the three of the four puru\\u1e63\\u0101rtha-s, where mok\\u1e63a is omitted. \\u015aiva is a very clever personality, as after all He is the Supreme Creator. Par\\u0101\\u015bakti knows that the above mantra or any other mantras revealed by \\u015aiva so far, are not capable of conferring liberation. The one b\\u012bja that is capable of conferring mok\\u1e63a is par\\u0101b\\u012bj\\u0101 (sau\\u1e25 \\u0938\\u094c\\u0903). If we look at any of \\u015ar\\u012b Vidy\\u0101 mantras such as B\\u0101l\\u0101, Saubh\\u0101gya Pa\\u00f1cada\\u015b\\u012b and \\u1e62o\\u1e0da\\u015b\\u012b, they will have par\\u0101b\\u012bj\\u0101. (sau\\u1e25 is made up of three b\\u012bja-s and they are \\u201cs\\u201d, which stands for sat Universal Spirit, \\u201cau\\u201d which stands for three powers of the Supreme Spirit viz. icc\\u0101 \\u015bakti, j\\u00f1\\u0101na \\u015bakti, and kriy\\u0101 \\u015bakti and \\u201c\\u1e25\\u201d stands for the Pure Consciousness of \\u015aiva).\\u015aiva has already revealed sixty four tantra-s (catu\\u1e63\\u1e63\\u1e6dy\\u0101 tantrai\\u1e25) to the world, by way His teachings to Par\\u0101\\u015bakti. Though the names of all these tantra-s are available, the names of tantra-s vary. It is also believed that total number of original tantra-s were more than sixty four, but only sixty four are available today and the rest were lost with time. These tantra-s, if practiced as revealed in the original Scriptures, are bound to give results much faster. Unfortunately, today there is no proper guidance to teach as per original tantric Scriptures and hence no one derives siddhi-s in the present world.Worshipping Devi is known as Tantra and the Supreme form of Her worship is \\u015ar\\u012b Vidy\\u0101, which means auspicious knowledge. It is called auspicious because, all the mantras of \\u015ar\\u012b Vidy\\u0101 confer liberation, provided the procedures are meticulously followed. The basis of \\u015ar\\u012b Vidy\\u0101 is Pa\\u00f1cada\\u015b\\u012b Mantra, which is explained in THIS ARTICLE. But Par\\u0101\\u015bakti pleads with \\u015aiva to reveal a tantra that is capable of conferring all the four puru\\u1e63\\u0101rtha-s \\u2013 dharma (discharging duty as per precepts of dharma); artha (acquiring material wealth in a proper way); k\\u0101ma (gratifying desires in the manner prescribed in the above two); and mok\\u1e63a (final liberation, emancipation). Hence \\u015ar\\u012b Vidy\\u0101 comes under tantra-s. There are other interpretations about what \\u015aiva has actually revealed to Par\\u0101\\u015bakti. There are arguments saying that what \\u015aiva had revealed is not \\u015ar\\u012b Vidy\\u0101 tantra but V\\u0101make\\u015bvara tantra, which also deals with Her worship. The difference between \\u015ar\\u012b Vidy\\u0101 and V\\u0101make\\u015bvara is where the former takes the worshipper directly to Par\\u0101\\u015bakti and in the latter, one has to go through m\\u0101t\\u1e5bk\\u0101 dev\\u012bs and tithi nity\\u0101 dev\\u012bs. Therefore, it is always considered that \\u015ar\\u012b Vidy\\u0101 is the best form of worship to attain Her. Worshipping Goddesses is known as Tantra.\\u015aiva Himself worshipped Her through His own Pa\\u00f1cada\\u015b\\u012b Mantra:\\u0939 \\u0938 \\u0915 \\u0932 \\u0939\\u094d\\u0930\\u0940\\u0902\\u0964 \\u0939 \\u0938 \\u0915 \\u0939 \\u0932 \\u0939\\u094d\\u0930\\u0940\\u0902\\u0964 \\u0938 \\u0915 \\u0932 \\u0939\\u094d\\u0930\\u0940\\u0902\\u0964 \\u0939 \\u0938 \\u0915 \\u0932 \\u0939 \\u0938 \\u0915 \\u0939 \\u0932 \\u0938 \\u0915 \\u0932 \\u0939\\u094d\\u0930\\u0940\\u0902 \\u0964ha sa ka la hr\\u012b\\u1e41 | ha sa ka ha la hr\\u012b\\u1e41 | sa ka la hr\\u012b\\u1e41 | ha sa ka la ha sa ka ha la sa ka la hr\\u012b\\u1e41  There is another variation:\\u0915 \\u090f \\u0908 \\u0932 \\u0939\\u094d\\u0930\\u093f\\u0902\\u0964 \\u0939  \\u0938 \\u0915 \\u0932 \\u0939\\u094d\\u0930\\u0940\\u0902\\u0964 \\u0938 \\u0939 \\u0938 \\u0915 \\u0932 \\u0939\\u094d\\u0930\\u0940\\u0902\\u0964 \\u0915 \\u090f \\u0908 \\u0932 \\u0939 \\u0938 \\u0915 \\u0939 \\u0932 \\u0938 \\u0915 \\u0938 \\u0915 \\u0932 \\u0939\\u094d\\u0930\\u0940\\u0902 \\u0964ka e \\u012b la hri\\u1e41 | ha  sa ka la hr\\u012b\\u1e41 | sa ha sa ka la hr\\u012b\\u1e41 | ka e \\u012b la ha sa ka ha la sa ka sa ka la hr\\u012b\\u1e41  |Probably, the purpose of \\u015aiva\\u2019s \\u201cworship\\u201d could have been different, for example, energising Her, transferring His Absolute and Independent Power of Authority (Sv\\u0101tantrya \\u015aakti) to Her, etc. Question is asked by Par\\u0101\\u015bakti in this verse and the answer is by given in the next verse (32).  When \\u015aiva reveals to Her, \\u015ar\\u012b Vidy\\u0101 Tantra, it overrides all the other sixty four tantra-s as \\u015ar\\u012b Vidy\\u0101 gives emancipation, which other tantra-s do not give that easily. Hence it is often said that \\u015ar\\u012b Vidy\\u0101 is \\u201ckevalam mok\\u1e63a s\\u0101danam\\u201d (it is the only way to liberation).

Um\\u0101! The nails in Your hands (finger nails) make lotus flowers to blossom. Splendour of Your nails, make mockery of the radiance of just blossomed lotus flowers. Please tell me, how can I describe such beautiful hands of Yours? These lotus flowers got their radiance from the feet of Lak\\u1e63m\\u012b, who resides within lotus flowers and who sports henna in her feet. Even then, there cannot be any equality to Your splendour.\\u201dThis verse talks about Par\\u0101\\u015bakti\\u2019s hands. \\u015aa\\u1e41kar\\u0101c\\u0101rya could not find appropriate words to describe Her splendorous hands. It seems to be a tough job for him as if he is explaining Brahman, who cannot be described through words; but there is no other go except to draw comparisons to explain Him.  For example, Brahman is more radiant than millions of suns put together, etc. Similarly, \\u015aa\\u1e41kar\\u0101c\\u0101rya finds it difficult to describe Her hands. If this is the case with hands, how can Her full form be described? This is beyond human comprehension. That is why, \\u015aa\\u1e41kar\\u0101c\\u0101rya made an attempt to describe Her through 100 verses of Saundaryalahar\\u012b.\\u015aa\\u1e41kar\\u0101c\\u0101rya thought about closest possible similarity to describe Her hands. He says that goddess Lak\\u1e63m\\u012b, Consort of Vi\\u1e63\\u1e47u resides in lotus flowers. She has applied henna paste in her feet, which turned her feet deep red in colour and the lotus flowers derive their luster only from the feet of Lak\\u1e63m\\u012b and even then this comparison is not even the closest possible comparison to describe Par\\u0101\\u015bakti\\u2019s hands.This verse can be contemplated like this. Par\\u0101\\u015bakti\\u2019s nails are deep red in colour. The bright red radiance of Her nails get reflected in Her shining hands. If this can be compared to the just blossomed red lotus flower, people will laugh out loud for making this irrelevant comparison. But, there is no other way to describe Her radiant hands. So, Her hands cannot be compared to anything that is known to us. This is like making futile attempts to describe Brahman.Um\\u0101 is the name given to Her by Her mother. When She was too young, She used to practice austerities in order to attain \\u015aiva as Her Consort. Her mother at that time used to tell Her not to practice austerities at such a tender age. Um\\u0101 is explained like this. U stands for O! Child! and m\\u0101 stands for \\u2018do not practice austerities\\u2019. \\u201cO! Child! Do not practice austerities\\u201d is later known as Um\\u0101. \",\n          \"tvat bhajanav\\u0101n \\u2013 Your devotee; sarasvaty\\u0101 lak\\u1e63my\\u0101 \\u2013 in the company of Sarasvat\\u012b and Lak\\u1e63m\\u012b; vidhihari sapatna\\u1e25; their Consorts Brahm\\u0101 and Vi\\u1e63\\u1e47u; viharate \\u2013 take away (for courting); ramye\\u1e47a vapu\\u1e63a \\u2013 (by means of his) handsome body; rate\\u1e25 pativratya\\u1e41 \\u015bithilayati \\u2013 destroys the chastity of Rati; cira\\u1e41 j\\u012bvanneeva \\u2013 by remaining as an immortal; k\\u1e63apita pa\\u015bup\\u0101\\u015ba vyatikara\\u1e25 - freed his soul from the bondage of ignorance; par\\u0101nanda abhikhya\\u1e41 - splendour of the Supreme Bliss; rasayati rasa\\u1e41 - enjoys the essence. \\u201cYour devotee becomes enemy to Brahm\\u0101 and Vi\\u1e63\\u1e47u, as he takes away their Consorts Sarasvat\\u012b and Lak\\u1e63m\\u012b. By means of his handsome body, he also takes away Rati (the divine damsel). By attaining immortality, he has freed his soul from the bondage of ignorance and perpetually enjoys the essence of Supreme Bliss.\\u201dThis verse has only subtle meaning and if this is interpreted on the grosser side, it is absolutely wrong. The man that is referred here is the one who has excelled in samay\\u0101c\\u0101ra worship. When he has already merged his individual consciousness with Supreme Consciousness (\\u015aiva), he needs nothing in this material world. By worshiping Her, he has attained everything \\u2013 supreme spiritual knowledge, enough material wealth and physical fitness. By referring to Sarasvat\\u012b and Lak\\u1e63m\\u012b, \\u015aa\\u1e41kar\\u0101c\\u0101rya conveys that such a devotee has attained everything that is possible in his living. By referring to Rati, he says that this yogi\\u2019s body automatically attains eternal youthfulness. By uniting his j\\u012bv\\u0101tman (the self) with Param\\u0101tman (the Self), he becomes a j\\u012bvanmukta (liberated while living). He enjoys every minute of his j\\u012bvanmukta state, as he always remains in the state of Supreme Bliss. He perpetually remains in the state of Supreme Bliss. \\u015aa\\u1e41kar\\u0101c\\u0101rya uses the word \\u201cpar\\u0101nanda\\u201d (the state of spiritual ecstasy or Supreme Bliss).J\\u012bvanmukta, though liberated completely in this life, continues to exist with his body to exhaust the remnants of his karmic impressions. During this life, he has been rewarded by Her as he had pursued four puru\\u1e63\\u0101rtha-s (puru\\u1e63\\u0101rtha means object of human life), dharma, artha, k\\u0101ma and mok\\u1e63a, in the most rightful manner. Dharma is a way of living without hurting others and following dictums of \\u015b\\u0101stra-s. It is a way of discharging one\\u2019s duty, without hurting others either physically or mentally. Artha is the right way of earning material wealth. He is able to earn wealth better than others, as he has Her Grace. By earning wealth, he gives away his wealth to others, after decently maintaining his family. In other words, he distributes his excess, after saving for his family\\u2019s future, for the purpose of charity. This is because, as far as he is concerned, everything is Brahman to him. He cannot see others suffering. He has highest level of philanthropic attitude (Recently Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, etc are living examples). Instead of multiplying his wealth beyond a point, he shares his excessive wealth with needy and derives inexplicable happiness. K\\u0101ma means all types of his desires. Desire for spiritual pursuit, desire for maintaining harmony, desire for both mental and physical happiness, etc are classified under k\\u0101ma.  When he has attained everything, he needs nothing to attain. After having fully lived his life, he aspires for mok\\u1e63a, the liberation.This sincere devotee has evolved to this stage by his sheer spiritual practices and deep love for Her. He fully understands that he can be liberated from the pains of transmigration only by the Divine Mother, who is always compassionate. He has moved faster from the mundane stage of his existence to this Blissful state. He fully understands the sayings of Adhy\\u0101tmar\\u0101m\\u0101ya\\u1e47a (B\\u0101lak\\u0101\\u1e47\\u1e0da \\u2013 verse 51), \\u201cKnowing this (you are That or you are Brahman), my devotees attain Me. Those who are devoid of devotion to Me, roll in the abyss of \\u015b\\u0101stra-s. Theirs is neither knowledge nor emancipation, even through hundreds of transmigration.\\u201d (For a Self-realized person, dictums of \\u015b\\u0101stra-s and procedures do not matter as he is fully aware that reality is Brahman alone.)How liberation happens? Kaivalya is the final stage of life, of a living being.  Nobody is there with that being during that time.  He is all alone without any help around and he has to achieve on his own.  This is the final stage of one\\u2019s evolution.  The soul is about to leave its present body and getting ready to merge with the Brahman.  Kaivalya is liberation or salvation and hence it is called the final stage.  This final stage can be reached in two ways.  One is the mundane stage associated with desires and attachments where soul gets ready for rebirth.  The other stage is the stage of sam\\u0101dhi, where the soul gets ready for its union with the Brahman not to be born again.  This is kaivalya.  Par\\u0101\\u015bakti is the giver of this stage. There are four types of consciousness.  They are s\\u0101lokya, sar\\u016bpa, sam\\u012bbha and s\\u0101yujya.  Beyond this is kaivalya.  S\\u0101lokya is the stage where one performs ritual worship, worshipping idols or portraits of gods.  In sar\\u016bpa he leaves idol worship and does not differentiate himself from god.  In sam\\u012bbha he goes near the god and in s\\u0101yujya stage he merges with god.  These are the stages of one\\u2019s consciousness that finally lead to kaivalya.  One has to progress from one stage to another and this progression happens depending upon the level of spirituality.  By being spiritual does not mean that one has to be religious.  Spirituality transcends religious affinities, though religion forms the foundation of spirituality.  To attain kaivalya stage one has to progress from ritual worship to mental worship (meditation).  By making sufficient progress in meditation, one has to search for the Brahman within.  Once the Brahman is located and realized within, the practitioner moves to the stage of kaivalya, by detaching himself from worldly affinities by staying connected with his Creator.  His soul is now under preparation to merge with Him, for final liberation. Finally, he gets liberated with no further transmigration for that soul. Similar message is conveyed through Saundaryalahar\\u012b (verse 22). \\u201cO! Bhav\\u0101ni! The one who addresses You as Bhav\\u0101ni seeking your compassion to bestow Your glance on him considering him as Your servant, offered liberation by You instantaneously, even before he could complete the word Bhav\\u0101ni...\\u201dIn a nutshell, this verse (99) conveys the benefits of worshiping Divine Mother. In the highest level of devotion, the difference between Her and yogi is annihilated and they both become one, the state of kaivalya. Just before entering into the state of kaivalya, devotion for Her transforms into love for Her. When the love for Her is intensified, the yogi loses all worldly interests and perpetually stays with Her waiting for Her approval to get liberated.\",\n          \"gir\\u0101m dev\\u012b\\u1e41 - the goddess of speech, Sarasvat\\u012b; druhi\\u1e47a g\\u1e5bhi\\u1e47\\u012bm \\u2013 consort of Brahm\\u0101 (Sarasvat\\u012b); \\u0101hu\\u1e25 - describe You; \\u0101gama vida\\u1e25 - knowers of \\u0101gama \\u015b\\u0101stra-s; hare\\u1e25 patn\\u012b\\u1e41 padma\\u1e41 - consort of Hari (Vi\\u1e63\\u1e47u) Lak\\u1e63m\\u012b; hara saha car\\u012bm \\u2013 Consort of \\u015aiva; adritanay\\u0101m \\u2013 daughter of Mountain (Himavat), P\\u0101rvat\\u012b; turiy\\u0101 k\\u0101pi \\u2013 the fourth stage of consciousness; tva\\u1e41 - Your; duradhigama ni\\u1e25s\\u012bma mahim\\u0101 \\u2013 inscrutable and infinite Glory; mah\\u0101m\\u0101y\\u0101 - the great Divine Power of illusion (mah\\u0101m\\u0101y\\u0101 is of two types, which is discussed in the interpretation below); vi\\u015bva\\u1e41 bhramayasi \\u2013 causing perplexity in the universe; parabrahma mahi\\u1e63i \\u2013 the Consort of Supreme Brahman (Parama\\u015biva).\\u201cWise and learned men describe You as Sarasvat\\u012b, the Consort of Brahm\\u0101 and Lak\\u1e63m\\u012b, the Consort of Vi\\u1e63\\u1e47u and also as the daughter of Himav\\u0101n, the Consort of \\u015aiva. But, You are the great Divine Power with inscrutable and infinite Glory, the Consort of Supreme Brahman Parama\\u015biva. You are the fourth stage of Consciousness\\u201dThis is one of the bejewelled verses of Saundaryalahar\\u012b, which describes the Powers of \\u015aiva and \\u015aakti. It is necessary to understand two words in this verse before we understand the grandeur of this verse.Parabrahman: Though Ved\\u0101nta describes Parabrahman without any name, for the sake of realizing His Glory and Grandeur, He is described here as Parama\\u015biva. Parama\\u015biva is explained in this article.Mah\\u0101m\\u0101y\\u0101 (Reproduced from Lalit\\u0101 Sahasran\\u0101ma 215): M\\u0101y\\u0101 means illusion.  She is known as mah\\u0101-m\\u0101y\\u0101 svar\\u016bpin\\u012b.  The entire universe functions on the basis of m\\u0101y\\u0101 or illusion.  If She does not cast Her effect of m\\u0101y\\u0101 on this world, there will no activity at all.  Her spell of m\\u0101y\\u0101 makes us to seek the Brahman, Heranother form, Pr\\u0101ka\\u015ba Vimar\\u015ba Mah\\u0101-m\\u0101y\\u0101 svar\\u016bpin\\u012b.  Even the sages and saints are no exception to Her spell of m\\u0101y\\u0101.  The intensity of m\\u0101y\\u0101 is felt depending upon one\\u2019s karma.  In advaita philosophy (non-dualism) to some thinkers the terms m\\u0101y\\u0101 and avidy\\u0101 mean the same thing. But some advaitins differentiate them and say that m\\u0101y\\u0101 is an auxiliary to \\u012a\\u015bvar\\u0101 and avidy\\u0101 is an auxiliary to soul. The main function of m\\u0101y\\u0101 is projection, projecting the Brahman in various shapes and forms.  But avidy\\u0101 can both obscure and project, but covering is the main function of avidy\\u0101. According to some, the substrate of avidy\\u0101 is soul and according to some others, avidy\\u0101 resides in the Brahman. The root of m\\u0101y\\u0101 is m\\u0101 which means \\u2018to measure\\u2019. The infinite Brahman appears as if measured due to the effect of m\\u0101y\\u0101. The root m\\u0101 also means, leading to the ideal of illusionary appearance.  The word m\\u0101y\\u0101 can be split into m\\u0101 + y\\u0101.  Then it means that which is not, but appears to be. M\\u0101y\\u0101 is regarded as \\u015aakt\\u012b, the attribute of the Brahman.  Brahman is essentially without attributes and is known as nirgu\\u1e47a Brahman.  But viewed in relation to m\\u0101y\\u0101, it is sagu\\u1e47a Brahman or with attributes.  Just as a magician conjures up many things by his magical power which he really does not possess, so Brahman with m\\u0101y\\u0101 \\u015bakt\\u012b projects the appearance of the world.  As things conjured up by the magician are false, so the projected world is ultimately false.  The phenomenal world is mere illusion or m\\u0101y\\u0101.  It is in reality non-existent. It appears to exist only because of the external objects that are related in the self, behind the mind.  It is nothing but a mere illusory projection of \\u0101tman.According to Trika Philosophy, Mah\\u0101m\\u0101y\\u0101 is of two kinds. One is apar\\u0101 and another is par\\u0101. Apar\\u0101 Mah\\u0101m\\u0101y\\u0101 is the state of the aspirant, whose awareness is pure. This aspirant is free from karma and m\\u0101y\\u0101, but he is not free from ego, hence the one who attains this state is called vij\\u00f1\\u0101nakal\\u0101, the state of no-bliss. Typically speaking, this is the first step towards Self-realization and the one who reaches this state never falls from his existing spiritual level. From this state, the aspirant moves forward to his ultimate goal of liberation on his own. He does not need a preceptor. This is the state of \\u015auddha Vidy\\u0101, where I and This (more emphasis on This than I) are still present because of the presence of ego. If ego is dissolved, he will not take notice of This as there cannot be any difference between Brahman and him (the principle of aha\\u1e41 brahm\\u0101smi).  Therefore, this is the stage of transition of the aspirant into that of a yogi (yoking of the self with the Self). Another is Par\\u0101 Mah\\u0101m\\u0101y\\u0101, where aspirants are realised souls, but still consider the material world different from them. In Apar\\u0101 Mah\\u0101m\\u0101y\\u0101, only Prak\\u0101\\u015ba (\\u015aiva) is present without Vimar\\u015ba (\\u015aakti). Apar\\u0101 Mah\\u0101m\\u0101y\\u0101 is above m\\u0101y\\u0101 and Par\\u0101 Mah\\u0101m\\u0101y\\u0101 is the lowest strata in Suddhavidy\\u0101 and below this is m\\u0101y\\u0101 (illusion and duality). If one falls from Suddha Vidy\\u0101, he again enters to the unfathomable pit of m\\u0101y\\u0101. It is also important to understand that all types of m\\u0101y\\u0101 are only the Absolute Power of Authority of \\u015aiva, which is also known as His sv\\u0101tantrya \\u015bakti. This sv\\u0101tantrya \\u015bakti of \\u015aiva is known as \\u015aakti and She is not a separate entity and is part of \\u015aiva. With this brief introduction, we now enter into the discussion part of this verse.This verse says that She is not just Sarasvat\\u012b, Lak\\u1e63im\\u012b and P\\u0101rvat\\u012b; but She is the Consort of Parabrahman, Parama\\u015biva, hence She is adored as Parabrahmamahi\\u1e63i. The moment we hear about parabrahmamahi\\u1e63i, our thoughts go to Lalit\\u0101 Sahasran\\u0101ma 233, mah\\u0101k\\u0101me\\u015bamahi\\u1e63\\u012b and the next n\\u0101ma Mah\\u0101tripurasundar\\u012b. K\\u0101\\u00f1c\\u012b Param\\u0101c\\u0101rya has given a detailed interpretation for this verse. In the first place, he says that She is Mahi\\u1e63i and not Mah\\u0101r\\u0101j\\u00f1\\u012b (Lalit\\u0101 Sahasran\\u0101ma 2). He explains the difference between Mahi\\u1e63i and Mah\\u0101r\\u0101j\\u00f1\\u012b, He says, \\u201cMahi\\u1e63i means the chief queen of the king; but Mah\\u0101r\\u0101j\\u00f1\\u012b means a queen who rules in her own right. In this verse, She is not addressed Mah\\u0101r\\u0101j\\u00f1\\u012b, but as Mahi\\u1e63i, which clearly explains that She is the Consort of Parama\\u015biva and not a Supreme Queen who has absolute power of authority. Therefore, it is authoritatively concluded that She is not the ultimate authority, but Parama\\u015biva is the ultimate authority of the universe. Yet, She alone is powerful as She is the Sv\\u0101tantrya \\u015aakti of \\u015aiva and nobody has this kind of power of authority except Parabrahmamahi\\u1e63i.Next question that arises in our minds is whether Sarasvat\\u012b, Lak\\u1e63im\\u012b and P\\u0101rvat\\u012b come under Her control? This can be explained in two different angles. As long as we distinguish between different forms of gods and goddesses, we follow only Dvailta philosophy (dualism). From moving to Advaita from Dvaita probably could take several births. Entering into the path of Advaita is the beginning point of spiritual life. All kinds of external worships fall under Dvaita only. As long as we consider Her different from us, it is only dualistic worship. Non-dualistic contemplation can happen only in the mind. When She is known as Par\\u0101\\u015bakti, She encompasses every aspect of Brahman.The other interpretation is based on Lalit\\u0101 Sahasran\\u0101ma 614, Sac\\u0101mara-ram\\u0101-v\\u0101\\u1e47\\u012b-savyadak\\u1e63i\\u1e47a-sevit\\u0101, which says, \\u201cGoddess Lak\\u1e63m\\u012b (Ram\\u0101) and Goddess Sarasvat\\u012b (V\\u0101\\u1e47\\u012b) stand by Her side and fan Her.  This n\\u0101ma means that those who contemplate Her get wealth and intelligence without even asking for them.\\u201d This can be further explained that every creation comes under Her direct control and supervision. This verse does not in any way undermine other deities, but explicitly says that She alone is the Supreme Authority, simply because, She holds the unique and Absolute Power of \\u015aiva and the entire creation begins from this Power, known as Mah\\u0101m\\u0101y\\u0101 or Par\\u0101\\u015bakti.The next question that arises in our mind is as to why \\u015aa\\u1e41kar\\u0101c\\u0101rya chose this specific verse to demystify Parabrahman (who is named as Parama\\u015biva for the purpose of understanding) and Mah\\u0101m\\u0101y\\u0101 in this verse? In the initial verses of Saundaryalahar\\u012b, he described about Her various attributes, which enabled us to contemplate Her form well. During the first part of Saundaryalahar\\u012b, he described Her gross form and in the next part \\u0100nandalahar\\u012b, \\u015aa\\u1e41kar\\u0101c\\u0101rya dwelt on \\u0100nanda or Bliss, which is Her essential nature. When \\u015aiva is Cit, She is \\u0100nanda, and they are together known as Cid\\u0101nanda (ultimate reality of both Consciousness and Bliss existing together), which can be compared to \\u015aiva-\\u015bakty-aikya-r\\u016bpi\\u1e47\\u012b (Lalit\\u0101 Sahasran\\u0101ma 999). Though Cid\\u0101nanda can be explained differently, the subtle meaning is that \\u0100nanda does not exist as a separate entity, but exists inherently in Cit (Consciousness or \\u015aiva). This is known as Parama\\u015biva. The subtle conveyance of this verse is, as we progress in our spiritual path, we have to move away from Mah\\u0101m\\u0101y\\u0101 to Parama\\u015biva. Par\\u0101\\u015bakti can only pave way for liberation, by showering Her Grace on us (\\u015aaktip\\u0101ta), but the final liberation can be given only by \\u015aiva.  When \\u015aakti dissolves into obliviousness, \\u015aiva is realized. In other words, duality of worldly process (m\\u0101y\\u0101) is dissolved, Brahman is realized.There is yet another conveyance in this verse about the fourth stage of consciousness. There are three states of consciousness, j\\u0101grat, (normal active stage, or stage of awakening) svapna (dream stage) and su\\u1e63upti (deep sleep state). Beyond these three normal and mundane levels of consciousness, there are two other stages known as turya and tury\\u0101t\\u012bta. Turya is the fourth stage of consciousness, which is used in this verse.  It cannot be experienced automatically.  This stage can be attained only through meditation.  This stage is not related to any of the three mundane stages.  In the waking stage we are associated with consciousness.  In the dream stage our mind is associated with our consciousness.  In the third stage of dream-less sleep, consciousness has no part to play as the mind at this stage is at rest.  But in turya stage, one has to tune his mind to become unaware of consciousness.  This can be attained only by practice.  In this stage one is neither the Brahman nor his own self.  If one is able to advance to the next stage of tury\\u0101t\\u012bta, he merges with the Brahman.  If he falls from turya stage, he is again bound by worldly actions and the associated miseries.  She exists in the form of turya stage.  This state of consciousness is witnessing the consciousness of the other three stages (in the deep sleep, consciousness is inactive). The consciousnesses in the other three stages are subjected to modifications.  In this stage, the consciousness alone remains looking up for something Superior that has not been experienced by it so far.  Therefore the normal consciousness ceases to exist in this stage.  Only when we talk about consciousness, we talk about subject and object.  There is no subject and no object and in fact nothing exists.  This stage of \\u2018nothing exists\\u2019 leads to the transformation of awareness.  This can possibly be interpreted as a seed ready to sprout.  The transformed consciousness leads to the single pointed or focused consciousness to know about the Brahman or even ready to merge with it.K\\u0101\\u00f1ci Paramac\\u0101ya (Voice of God) in his discourse on this verse said, \\u201cNirgu\\u1e47a Brahman has no connection with M\\u0101y\\u0101. In order to take people practicing devotion according to \\u015a\\u0101kta doctrine, \\u015aa\\u1e41kar\\u0101c\\u0101rya makes Parabrahman and Mah\\u0101m\\u0101y\\u0101 as Divine Couple.\\u201d This means that only Brahman exists everywhere and He alone is to be realized. Following \\u015a\\u0101kta doctrine is only to understand the Supreme Power of Brahman, which is projected as Par\\u0101\\u015bakti. The idea is that one has to first understand Absolute Power of Brahman, which is termed as Par\\u0101\\u015bakti. When His Power Par\\u0101\\u015bakti is realized, it is comparatively easier for all of us to realize Brahman. K\\u1e5b\\u1e63\\u1e47a says in Bhagavad G\\u012bt\\u0101 (VII.25), \\u201cVeiled by My Yogam\\u0101y\\u0101, I am not manifest to all....\\u201d which goes to prove that Mah\\u0101m\\u0101y\\u0101 is nothing but the Divine Potency or Divine Power of illusion. By His own power, Brahman veils Himself through the effects of Mah\\u0101m\\u0101y\\u0101, making His realization difficult. In the process, we continue with all dualities, ego, pride, arrogance, etc. Those with these inferior qualities continue to remain as transmigratory objects without any hopes for liberation.Towards the end of Saundaryalahar\\u012b, \\u015aa\\u1e41kar\\u0101c\\u0101rya clearly explains the path of liberation to us. It is up to us assimilate his teachings and move forward towards the goal of Emancipation.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
